## Snort Lab Summary

In the Snort lab, I gained practical experience in installing and configuring Snort, a powerful network intrusion detection system. Here are the key points covered in the lab:

1. **Installation and Configuration**: I set up a virtualized environment and configured network settings to ensure internet connectivity. Snort was then installed on Kali Linux using provided commands.

2. **Rule Creation and Testing**: I created a custom Snort rule to detect specific traffic, such as ICMP ping requests to the Google DNS IP address. The rule was added to the appropriate rules file, and Snort successfully detected and generated alerts for the specified traffic.

3. **Rule Management**: I learned how to manage Snort rules by enabling or disabling them through the configuration file. This allowed me to tailor Snort's behavior to suit my network security needs effectively.

4. **Exploring Snort Rules**: I browsed the Snort rules directory and gained familiarity with the available rule sets. This helped me understand the extensive capabilities of Snort in detecting various types of network intrusions.

In conclusion, the Snort lab provided hands-on experience in installing, configuring, and utilizing Snort for network intrusion detection. Through this lab, I gained the knowledge and skills to identify and protect my network, create custom rules, and effectively utilize Snort's detection capabilities. The acquired expertise will play a crucial role in enhancing network security by proactively detecting and responding to potential intrusions and attacks.
